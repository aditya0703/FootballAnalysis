# FootballAnalysis

This program called FootballAnalysis is created by Aditya Khanna. The program uses a statistic sheet from Pro Football References and has an in-built algorithim that uses the statistics to predict the outcomes of NFL Football matchups. This program outputs estimates of the final score, point differential, total points, and yardage by team. These outputs are used to assist in sports betting, however, I do not encourage sports betting and am not liable for any gains or losses you have experience by using my program.

# Stats
- PF: Total Points scored by the team during this season
- PA: Total Points allowed by the team during this season
- YPG: Total Yards per Game produced by the team during this season
-YAPG: Total Yards Allowed per Game by the team during this season
- SOS: Strength of Schedule of the team

Thank you for using this football analysis program!
